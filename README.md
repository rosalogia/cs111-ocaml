# CS111 OCaml

This repository houses a collection of idiomatic and well-commented solutions to problems from Rutgers New Brunswick's introductory
programming course for computer science majors. The intention of the repository is to show how problems students once solved with
an imperative or object oriented approach can be solved idiomatically in a functional programming language. If you are here in search
of solutions for your 111 homework, you are out of luck. None of these solutions translate well to Java and make frequent use of
features and syntax that Java does not have. If you have the brain-power to read these solutions and determine from them how to implement
them in Java, you are just as well prepared to solve these problems on your own. Please do not waste your time or cause problems for people
who otherwise might benefit from this as a way to learn OCaml and functional programming.

### Building

Each assignment folder contains a Makefile, so running `make` is enough to build binaries for each of the programs. This
does assume you have OCaml installed and in your PATH, though. All the programs accept command-line args rather than stdin.
